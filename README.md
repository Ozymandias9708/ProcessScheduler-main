# Process Scheduler
This repository contains a C++ program that simulates various process scheduling algorithms. It's designed to demonstrate the fundamental concepts of process scheduling in operating systems.

## Features

- Simulation of different scheduling algorithms:
  - First Come First Served (FCFS)
  - Shortest Job First (SJF)
  - Priority Scheduling
  - Round Robin (RR)
  - Multilevel Queue Scheduling (MQS)
- Dynamic process generation
- Display of process attributes and statistics

## Acknowledgments
The project is intended for educational purposes and to demonstrate process scheduling algorithms in action.
This project was created for the Operating Systems course, within the "Information Sciences and Technologies" studies at the "Universit√† degli Studi della Basilicata".
